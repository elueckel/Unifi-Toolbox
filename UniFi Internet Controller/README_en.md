Configuration page__:

**Type of controller**
As the APIs of CloudKey 1 and CloudKey2/DreamMachine differ, the controller can be selected here

**Username & Password**
Account with which the module connects to the controller

**Site**
Site name that is stored in the controller (default: "default").

ATTENTION: Do not confuse this with the site description, which can be changed in the controller GUI, for example!

The site name can be checked by clicking on "check Site Name".

**IP address and port**
For the DreamMachine the port is 443, for a controller it is 8443 by default. IP address of the CloudKey or the DreamMachine.

**Update frequency**
As the controller must be actively polled, you can enter a frequency here for how often this should happen. 

**Connection data**
If this switch is activated, the module queries the controller for connection data.

**Debugging**
The module outputs various information in the debug area.
