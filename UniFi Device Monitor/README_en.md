Configuration page__:

**Type of controller**
As the APIs of CloudKey 1 and CloudKey2/DreamMachine differ, the controller can be selected here

**Username & Password**
Account with which the module connects to the controller

**Site**
Site name that is stored in the controller (default: "default").

ATTENTION: Do not confuse this with the site description, which can be changed in the controller GUI, for example!

The site name can be checked by clicking on "check Site Name".

**IP address and port**
For the DreamMachine the port is 443, for a controller it is 8443 by default. IP address of the CloudKey or the DreamMachine.

**Update frequency**
As the controller must be actively polled, you can enter a frequency here for how often this should happen. 

**MAC address**
The MAC address of the device to be monitored. This is best read from the controller.

**Device type**
Choice between UDM/USG devices that are connected to the Internet and generic devices. Less data is available for generic devices. 

**Basic data - Available for all devices**
Network data includes logical data such as device model, software version, satisfaction, last seen, uptime, name. 

**Hardware data - Available for all devices**
This setting reads the CPU and memory load.

**Connection data - only available for firewalls such as UDM/USG**
Network data such as public IP, transmitted data, packets and errors

**Transmission data**
For WLAN devices, information on transmitted data and packets is provided here.

**Debugging**
The module outputs various information in the debug area.
