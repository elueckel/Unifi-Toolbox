Configuration page__:

**Type of controller**

As the APIs of CloudKey 1 and CloudKey2/DreamMachine differ, the controller can be selected here

**Username & Password**

Account with which the module connects to the controller

**Site**

Site name that is stored in the controller (default: "default").

ATTENTION: Do not confuse this with the site description, which can be changed in the controller GUI, for example!

The site name can be checked by clicking on "check Site Name".

**IP address and port**

For the DreamMachine the port is 443, for a controller it is 8443 by default. IP address of the CloudKey or the DreamMachine.

**Update frequency**

As the controller must be actively polled, you can enter a frequency here for how often this should happen. 

**MAC address**

The MAC address of the device to be monitored. This is best read from the controller.

**Type of connection**

Different information is available based on the type of connection. Most are generated by devices in the WLAN. 

**Network data**

Network data includes logical data such as IP address or host name. 

**Connection data**

Available physical data is provided here. For WLAN devices, this includes information on connection quality, last seen, uptime, channel, type of technology, SSID, attenuation, signal strength. 

**Transmission data**

For WLAN devices, information on transmitted data and packets is provided here.

**Debugging**

The module outputs various information in the debug area.
